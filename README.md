### 👨‍💻 About me

- I craft end‑to‑end systems: data pipelines → models → APIs → UX.
- Comfortable across backend and frontend, with a strong math foundation.
- Daily driver: Ubuntu on laptop; additional Ubuntu GPU server (RTX 3080 with CUDA) reachable over ZeroTier.
- Primary editor: VS Code.
- Timezone: Asia/Seoul (UTC+9).

### 🚀 What I am building

**MangoBerry — restaurant review and recommendation platform**
- Backend: FastAPI with JWT auth, Nginx reverse proxy, and Dockerized deployment.
- Search: Elasticsearch for restaurant, review, and keyword retrieval with tuned analyzers and scoring.
- Data: MySQL for relational entities, MongoDB for documents and media.
- Personalization: Preference‑aware scoring that blends user signals with keyword analysis.
- Frontend: React with a map‑based UI (Kakao Maps), word clouds, and profile features (follows, compatibility ratings).
- Infra: AWS EC2 (service and database instances), containerized services, SSL termination, and CI‑ready layout.
- Recent experiments: Python 3.13‑t (nogil) Docker builds to test throughput under concurrency.

> I enjoy turning messy, real‑world requirements into clear interfaces and measurable outcomes.

### 🧰 Tech I use

- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, a bit of C
- **ML / DL / LLM:** PyTorch, Transformers, scikit‑learn, evaluation and prompt engineering workflows
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- **Data Stores:** MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch
- **Frontend:** React, Vite/CRA, modern CSS tooling
- **DevOps / Infra:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, AWS EC2, ZeroTier
- **OS / Tools:** Ubuntu, Vim, VS Code, Graphviz (for diagrams)

### 🗺️ Selected architecture highlights

- **Service boundary:** React SPA served by Nginx; `/api/*` requests proxied to FastAPI.
- **Data boundary:** OLTP in MySQL, document storage and media in MongoDB, search and analytics in Elasticsearch.
- **Observability:** Structured logs at the API boundary; query timing and search diagnostics to iterate on relevance.
- **Deployment:** Docker images per service; environment‑driven configuration; production Nginx with request size caps aligned to API.

### 🧪 Interests

- Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) with robust indexing and evaluation loops  
- Search relevance: analyzers, scoring, and user modeling  
- Fast Python in production: asyncio, multiprocess strategies, and (selectively) nogil builds  
- Practical MLOps: data contracts, regression tests for models and prompts, and reproducible deployments

---

### 🤝 I am open to

- Collaborations on search, recommendations, or LLM evaluation tooling  
- Consulting on FastAPI backends, Elasticsearch integration, and Dockerized deployments  
- Performance tuning for Python services and query optimization
